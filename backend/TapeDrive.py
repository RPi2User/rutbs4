    No we need to get our Hands VERY dirty.
    I'm trying my best to make this as easy as possible, you've been warned!
    
    The command 'sg_modes --raw /dev/sgX' returns the "Mode Parameter Header for Mode Sense (10)"
    This is a special data block used to show supported features.
    
    user@tape-server:~$ sg_modes --all /dev/sgX
            IBM       ULT3580-HH8       MA71   peripheral_type: tape [0x1]
        Mode parameter header from MODE SENSE(10):
        Mode data length=231, medium type=0x88, specific param=0x90, longlba=0
        Block descriptor length=8
        > General mode parameter block descriptors:
        Density code=0x5e
        00     5e 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

    This software uses just two fields (in regard of getting Tape information):
        medium type=0x88, specific param=0x90
    
    When medium type = 0 no tape is inserted. Specific param = 0x10 means no write protection
    medium type = 0xX8 the X shows the LTO-Version
    specific param = 0x90 means write protect.
    
    I know those assumptions are quite risky. But yet again: Nothing is standardized :c

    *   Good News: You can always provide a manual override explicitly stating the LTO-Version. *
    *   When you override the LTO-Version the software assumes write-protect is off.            *
    *********************************************************************************************
    
    For Drive Identification it's a mess as well.
    
    Problem:
    SOME tape drives are using multiple scsi devices for the same drive.
    Like: my LTO8 is recognized either as /dev/st0 AND /dev/st1. 
    This project supports multiple drives per System.
    
    Worst case:
    Someone bought 2 Drives of the same model. Sadly there is no standardized Field for the Serial Number.
    We need to be creative... A LOT...
    
    Lets start with an easy example:
    
        sg_raw -r 1k /dev/sgX 0x12 0 0 0 60 0
    
    This is a "INQUIRY". This command says the following:
        Please send Op-Code 0x12 to /dev/sgX, tell /dev/sgX that we want the first 96 (0x60) Bytes of Data.
        @sg_raw we just want to see the first 1000 Bytes of Data. Skip the rest.
        
    This command returns following:
    
    usr@tape-server:~$ sg_raw -r 1k /dev/sgX 0x12 0 0 0 60 0 
        SCSI Status: Good 

        Received 58 bytes of data:
        00     01 80 03 02 35 00 01 30  49 42 4d 20 20 20 20 20    ....5..0IBM     
        10     55 4c 54 52 49 55 4d 2d  54 44 33 20 20 20 20 20    ULTRIUM-TD3

    As you can see, the tape brive is happy with just 58 bytes of response data.
    So we can reduce the INQUIRY-Request to 58 bytes like this:
    
    usr@tape-server:~$ sg_raw -r 1k /dev/sgX 0x12 0 0 0 3A 0
    
    note that, our `-r 1k` stays untouched hence we only need it to specify our STDOUT buffer.
    But don't let yourself fool you from that conclusion.
    
    Only the INQUIRY part is specified, not the response length...
    
    usr@tape-server:~$ sg_raw -r 1k /dev/sgY 0x12 0 0 0 60 0
        SCSI Status: Good 

        Received 70 bytes of data:
        00     01 80 06 12 41 01 10 02  49 42 4d 20 20 20 20 20    ....A...IBM

    Here you can see the LTO8 Drive returned even more information than the LTO3 Drive.
    So keeping your constraints wide is always a good thing in research.
    
    I choose this command to fetch the inquiry data:
    
    usr@tape-server:~$ sg_raw -r 1k /dev/sgX 12 1 83 0 2a 0
    SCSI Status: Good 

        Received 42 bytes of data:

    This command get used to determine the Vendor, Model and Serial.
    Works on my two drives maybe work on others as well. Yet again: Noting is really standartized >.<
    
    Byte Explanation:
    
        0x12 -> INQUIRY
        0x01 -> EVPD (enable vital product data), this enables reading the following Page 
        0x83 -> Device Identification Page, this returns any Data used for the Drive ID
        0x00 -> Length High-Byte
        0x2a -> Length Low-Byte
        0x00 -> Control, no Control byte
    
    drive.vendor, drive.model and drive.serial got their value like that:
    
    Raw-Binary: `018300260201002249424d2020202020554c545249554d2d544433202020202031323130313733313833`
    Seperated into 16byte-Blocks:
        0183002602010022 49424d2020202020 -> First 8 Byte got discarded, lower 8 Bytes will be treated as "VENDOR" until first Space (0x20)
        554c545249554d2d 5444332020202020 -> All 16 Byte will be treated as "MODEL" until first SPACE
        3132313031373331 3833             -> All 10 Byte will be treated as "SERIAL".
        
    Note: After the 10 serial bytes (byte) IBM continues with very vendor specific stuff so we cut here.
    When those 10 Bytes cant be displayed as ASCII-String it'll be shown in hex. e.g.:
    
    - 31 FF 57 54 30 38 33 36 02 31 -> this will be "0x31ff5754303833360231"
    
    HOPEFULLY this is unique enough to differenciate between two idenitcal Models.

    """_summary_
    This Backend is written for SCSI/SAS-Drives but can support other drives via an override.
    Due to the lack of a fibre channel drive I can't do any research to support them.
    MAYBE they are supported via the same SCSI Commands I HOPE this is the case.
        Please, if you have a spare FC-TapeDrive for me, please reach out!
    
    !!!             Currently only LTO-based tapes will be handled correctly!                   !!!
    
    A typical SCSI-Based Drive will be recognized on most linux systems as `/dev/*stX`.
    Like:
        - /dev/st0 
        - /dev/nst0 
        - /dev/nst1
        - ... 
        
    If you are interested on how this project recognize a valid drive, please go to backend.TD_Pool
    
    If you want to create an TapeDrive object just search for two different paths:
        - the non-rewinding path -> like /dev/nst0
        - the generic scsi path -> like /dev/sg0
        
    Both values can be easily found with this simple command `lsscsi -g`
    So in a python shell you can easily create a tape drive object with this two commands:
    
        ```python
        >>> from backend.TapeDrive import TapeDrive
        >>> tapedrive = TapeDrive("/dev/nst0", "/dev/sg0")
        ```

    Hence this project is optimized for API usage all __str__() functions will return a JSON string.
    
    If your drive is more an "exotic" one you can OVERRIDE some assumptions I made in this project.
    
    For example:
        Our imaginary drive is recognized by the linux kernel as `/dev/nst0`. With no generic path.
            !!! For this program to write multiple files, a NON REWINDING DRIVE is needed !!!
        
        ```python
        >>> from backend.TapeDrive import TapeDrive
        >>> from backend.Command import Command
        >>> td_custom = TapeDrive(path="/dev/nst0", genericPath="", drive_override=True)
        >>> td_custom.rewindCommand = Command("<YOUR REWIND COMMAND>")    # This can be a bash-script or a simple program call
        >>> td_custom.ejectCommand = Command("<YOUR EJECT COMMAND>")
        ```
        In theory you can also populate all other variables like vendor, model, serial or blocksize.

            NOTE: that all following FAILING commands (exit code != 0) will set the tape into an ERROR state
            This ERROR can be cleared with `td_custom.clearError()`

        If your drive won't be recognized by the backend, it's tape won't be either - most likely.
        So you can OVERRIDE the TAPE as well:
        
        ```python
        >>> from backend.Tape import Tape
        >>> tape = Tape("0800") # This sets: writeprotect = False, size = 0, state = ONLINE
        >>> td_custom.tapeOverride(tape)
        >>> td_custom.rewind()
        ```

        After a quick `print(td_custom)` you can validate it's state and you can write any Files:
        
        ```python
        >>> from backend.File import File
        >>> testFile = File(id=0, path="/mnt/some_large_file.img")
        >>> td_custom.write(testFile)
        >>> print(td_custom)

        As you can see our custum drive state is "IDLE", we aren't at BOT (begin of tape) anymore, our current tape
        state is "ONLINE". The "command" returned the exit code "0" so our write command was successful.
        
        I know the "raw" JSON string is not readable at all. 
        But given the complex nature of tape in general this object structure is necessary.
